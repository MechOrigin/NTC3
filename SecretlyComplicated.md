## Skeleton of the Material System
---

1. What we're looking for is the [Gregtech](https://github.com/GregTech-Intergalactical/GregTech) and [Antimatter API](https://github.com/GregTech-Intergalactical/AntimatterAPI) material system, such as dust, impure dust, nugget, ingot, raw, plate, rod, wire, gem, block, gear, dense plate, etc. As well as mekanisms ore processing: crystals, etc
    - Digging some material types in Gregtech sourcecode I found: ORE, CRUSHED, CRUSHED_PURIFIED, CRUSHED_CENTRIFUGED, DUST_IMPURE, DUST_PURE, RAW_ORE, ORE_SMALL, LENS, GEM_BRITTLE, GEM_POLISHED, PLATE, ROD, DUST, DUST_SMALL, DUST_TINY, INGOT, NUGGET, BLOCK, DENSE_PLATE, GEAR, WIRE
    - I love how they dynamically created colors for every material and used just 1 texture/overlay. It saves a lot on space and load time. I hate that Emendatus Enigmatica uses a different texture for EVERY material. Totally unnecessary, I can make it look good and not use up 4000kb (compressed jar).
2. Also looking for a rock strata type system like [Project Rankine](https://github.com/CannoliCatfish/project-rankine) where there are various igneous, metamorphic, sedimentary materials, but the main thing is the STRATA generation.
    - Upon digging I found this [Base Properties](https://github.com/CannoliCatfish/project-rankine/blob/93517a2ff22d4a64ccbca2d2f1b85c9d481c2cc4/src/main/java/com/cannolicatfish/rankine/init/RankineBlocks.java#L114) which lists every type of block material. The ones that we're most interested in are things that sort of overlap the gregtech materials like cassiterite, bauxite, sphalerite, etc. Another thing to note is that at this point we don't want to worry about polished, slabs, etc. Only the stones such as: PEGMATITE, GRAY_GRANITE, RHYOLITE, COMENDITE, GRANODIORITE, etc (these were just some igneous btw). Here are some images: [strata](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/436/419/310/172/2022-02-27_15.png), [strata2](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/thumbnails/436/418/310/172/2022-02-27_15.png)
    - I plan to contribute heavily on code for both, but priority at the moment is getting materials like gears and plates, impure dust, etc. So I can work on unifying again for NTC3.
3. I can work on all the textures, no problem!
